>ABI - It is the communication layer between solidity world and javascript world.

> Ganache/TestRPC - Our local test network is going to be created by a library called Ganache (previously called TestRPC). This is where we will deploy our bytecode (which we will get after compiling our contract).

> Test Architecture

Solidity Compiler : This will spit out 1) bytecode and 2)ABI
1)Bytecode- This bytecode will be deployed in our locally created test network by Ganache.
2)ABI - We are going to take our javascript interface(or ABI) and we are going to feed that into Web3.
Note: Web3 is a library that we use to get a programatic access to a deployed contract on the blockchain.
So, web3 is our portal to what is going on in the local test network

Terms related to test:
1)assert module - It is a standard module which is built into nodejs runtime. It is used for making assertions about test (we ware going to assert that some value is equal to another value).


We use Web3 constructor to make instances of web3 library. We can make multiple instances inside 1 project. the purpose of each instance is to connect with different Ethereum network
It is not common to access multiple networks from 1 application, genrally we will only work with 1 instance of Web3 at a time

Q.How the below code works?
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());
//We use Web3 to make instance of web3. Immediately after doing so, we have to do some configuration of the new instance that we have created. We have to something called "PROVIDER"
//Provider= It can be thought of like a communication layer b/w web3 library and some specific Ethereum netwrk. Every provider that we use of to connect to different network has an identical set of methods on it. These methods allow the web3 library to send a request over to a local ntwrk and to receive a response.
//Think of provider as a phone and, web3 and the Ethereum network to which we connect (Ganache in this case) as different people who want to communicate

Q. How will we use Mocha to test Ethereum
Cycle:
1. Mocha starts
2. Deploy a new contract
3. Manipulate the contract
4. Make an assertion about the contract
5. Go back to step 2

1. In step 1, mocha is going to boot up and automatically load up Inbox.test.js file and starts to execute the series of test in it
2. We r going to take our contract bytecode and deploy it to our local test network(ganache). This will deploy a new instance of our contract.
3. We will write some code to manipulate that contract in some fashion.
4. We will make some assertion about a value that is tied to the contract.
5. We then go back to the top, deploy a fresh new contract and then manipulate the contract in some other fashion.

Eg of testing.
class Car {
  park() {
    return 'stopped';
  }
  drive() {
    return 'vrooom';
  }
}

//it() is the fundamental
//describe is used to group together related tests
let car;
beforeEach(() => {
  car = new Car();
});
describe('Car', () => {
  // const car  = new Car();
  it('can park', () => {
    assert.equal(car.park(), 'stopped');
  });
  it('can drive', () => {
    // const car = new Car();
    assert.equal(car.drive(), 'vrooom');
  });
});
