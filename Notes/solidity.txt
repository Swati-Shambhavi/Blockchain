1. Anytime we want to update any data on the blockchain, we have to submit a transaction. We also have to wait for it to get mined (go through the proof of work algo). This rule will hold true for everything we do with Ethereum. 

2. Running contract function-
There are two ways in which a contract function is invoked. First when it involes updating the data and sencond when it doesn't update/change the data. 

> "Calling" a function: 
    *Cannot  modify the contact's data
    *Can return data
    *Runs instantly
    *Free to do

>  Sending a transaction to a function:
    *Can modify contact's data
    *Takes time to execute
    *Runs the transaction hash
    *Costs money
